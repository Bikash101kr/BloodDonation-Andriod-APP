# BloodDonation-Andriod-APP
The main goal of this project is to manage the blood stock in the blood bank by creating more possible blood donations. The system wonâ€™t store the blood but it will store the information about the blood. It will design in such a way that it keeps detailed information as well as separate information of all the locations where the blood is available and what kind of blood is available and in how much quantity. Also, it helps to find more donor which automatically increases more blood in stock and helps to solve the blood shortage problems. I hope that this application will be helpful when someone needs bloods in urgent, then this application will be his/her best friend and help the person finding the place nearby him/her very quickly
